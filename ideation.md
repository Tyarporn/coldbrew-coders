# Ideas for potential Discord Bot : 

- Bot that lets you track server activity and convert it into usable data for moderation purposes
- Bot that tracks stock / crypt tickers and gives you updates at specific intervals as well as red/green times
- The discord server should address a specific theme or topic and create the bots necessary to cater to the target audience of that market. 
- The bot can gather user information, post that information to a NoSQL database such as MongoDB and use that data to create value for the target market.
- Can use external APIs to store information such as financial data and display that data to users in a visual friendly way.
- Potentially create a bot that allows you to compile and deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain test networks for educational purposes.
