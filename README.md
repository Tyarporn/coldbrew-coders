# Coldbrew-Coders Discord Bots


# Product Vision Statement
The goal of the discord bot is to automate specific tasks that users would routinally conduct manually without the bot on the discord application. Discord is an innovative communication channel that allows the use of programmable bots designed to meet the needs of users. The friendly UI of the app provides a great environment for users to interact with bots. The discord bots are treated like users in the context of a discord communication channel and are meant to easily interact with other members of a server. There also exists extensive API documentation to virtually create anything within the scope of a programmer's imagination. This project will be a backend-intensive undertaking and will have the front-end development abstracted away using the discord develepor account, which allows you to test back-end code with discord's UI.

# Product History
The purpose of our project is to build a Discord bot using the tech stack mentioned in class. 
We will be using Python with Discord's Python library for the backend of the project, Heroku for cloud deployment, Github / Github Actions for version control, and Discord's API in order to interact with the Discord UI.

We are all interested in using this technology as we all share a common interest in gaming and the constant rise in use cases for Discord, and as a close derivative, Slack. By developing our skills in our product stack, we will not only learn skills to build for Discord, but apps that target other fields as well.
