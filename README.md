# Coldbrew-Coders Discord Bots


# Product Vision Statement[WIP]
Discord is an online Voice-over-Internet-Protocol(VoIP) and messaging application. In addition to messaging capabilities, Discord offers support for "bots", programmable robotic users that can interact with human users. These bots are capable of a plethora of interactive actions. For example, a Discord bot can help with the governance of a Discord server, relay real time sports game data, and even play music within a voice channel. 
The goal of our project is to design and build a Discord bot that can do many actionable tasks that are useful, intuitive, and entertaining to any Discord user. This project will be a backend-intensive undertaking and will have the frontend development abstracted away using a Discord developer account, which allows developers to test backend code with Discord's user interface.

# Product History [WIP]
The purpose of our project is to build a Discord bot using the tech stack mentioned in class. 
We will be using Python with Discord's Python library ```discord.py``` which contains extensive implementations for Discord's API in a pythonic way for the backend of the project, Heroku for cloud deployment, Github / Github Actions for version control, and Discord's API in order to interact with the Discord UI. In addition to the available libraries for python and discord, there is a flask module specifically designed for discord called ```flask_discord_interactions``` which enables the efficient use of flask as our routing framework. Furthermore, if we wish for the project to use a database, we can collect user data through the bot, store it in a database, and fetch the data for use in the application.

We are all interested in using this technology as we all share a common interest in gaming and the constant rise in use cases for Discord, and as a close derivative, Slack. By developing our skills in our product stack, we will not only learn skills to build for Discord, but apps that target other fields as well.
