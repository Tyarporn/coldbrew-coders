# Coldbrew-Coders Discord Bots


# Product Vision Statement
The goal of the discord bot is to automate specific tasks that users would routinally conduct manually without the bot on the discord application. Discord is an innovative communication channel that allows the use of programmable bots designed to meet the needs of users. The friendly UI of the app provides a great environment for users to interact with bots. The discord bots are treated like users in the context of a discord communication channel and are meant to easily interact with other members of a server. There also exists extensive API documentation to virtually create anything within the scope of a programmer's imagination. This project will be a backend-intensive undertaking and will have the front-end development abstracted away using the discord develepor account, which allows you to test back-end code with discord's UI. We have yet to decide on an actual product for the bot to act as, but we wish to expand the project by creating a discord communication server catered to the target market we are addressing. The discord bot is simply a tool provided by the server and the server will act as a one-stop shop for the target audience's needs. For example, if we were to create a gaming server targetted towards users who play a distinct game, we can whip up several bots addressing individual aspects of the game. Maybe a single bot could allow members of the server to schedule games or another can relay important game information. We wish to make a discord utopia full of bots that achieves a complete user experience as opposed to creating a single bot that pertains to one specific task.

# Product History
The purpose of our project is to build a Discord bot using the tech stack mentioned in class. 
We will be using Python with Discord's Python library ```discord.py``` which contains extensive implementations for Discord's API in a pythonic way for the backend of the project, Heroku for cloud deployment, Github / Github Actions for version control, and Discord's API in order to interact with the Discord UI. In addition to the available libraries for python and discord, there is a flask module specifically designed for discord called ```flask_discord_interactions``` which enables the efficient use of flask as our routing framework. Furthermore, if we wish for the project to use a database, we can collect user data through the bot, store it in a database, and fetch the data for use in the application.

We are all interested in using this technology as we all share a common interest in gaming and the constant rise in use cases for Discord, and as a close derivative, Slack. By developing our skills in our product stack, we will not only learn skills to build for Discord, but apps that target other fields as well.
